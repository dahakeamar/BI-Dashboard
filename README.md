### Below are the key steps I followed while creating the dashboard (In Short) :

- Step 1 : Treansform and Load data into Power BI Desktop, dataset is a csv file.
- Step 2 : Open power query editor and select only 2024 data.
- Step 3 : Edited all the null values
- Step 4 : creating custom columns (Total Sales of the customer)etc.
- Step 5 : also create measures to show the total sales, total mobile phone sales and total laptop sales. 
- Step 6 : Three card visuals were added to the canvas, one representing the total sales of both (Laptop and Mobile Phone) & other two representing the Total sales for laptop and Mobile Phone separatey.
           Using visual level filter from the filters pane, basic filtering was used & null values were unselected for consideration into average calculation.
- Step 7 : Visual filters (Slicers) were added for the product (Mobile Phone / Laptop).
- Step 8 : Text Box also added showing the heading of the dashboard (Mobile & Laptop sales data 2024).
- Step 9 : A line chare was also added to the report representing the sum of sales by month and product.
           
- Step 10 : A Clustered bar chart was also added to the report design area representing the  sum of the sales of the top 5 brands. this clustered bar chart also helps to know the total sales done by the brand from both the products.
- Step 11 : A Clustered column chart was also added to the report design area representing the  sum of the sales of the product by month and month sales.
